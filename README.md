# CustomMinds AI Onboarding Chatbot 🤖

This is my onboarding project as a trainee at CustomMinds AI. The goal is to build a chatbot that interacts with data stored in a MySQL database. It uses:

- 🧠 **LangChain** for conversational logic  
- 🧩 **LangGraph** for agent workflows and stateful orchestration  
- ⚡ **FastAPI** for backend APIs  
- 🐍 **Python** with `uv` for environment management  
- 💬 **React** for the frontend UI  
- 🗄️ **MySQL** for storing and retrieving data
